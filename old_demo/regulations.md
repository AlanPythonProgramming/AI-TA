### Section 1.
Does the response provide a COMPLETE solution to a problem with all of the steps and a COMPLETE mathematical derivation process or programming code?
You should answer no to the above if any of the following is true:
- the response only contains a few steps to solving the problem, not the entire solution
- the response discusses only conceptual solutions such as the algorithm or pseudocode and does not provide everything the student needs to solve the problem.

### Section 2.
Does any part of the response contain topics unrelated to math and computer science?
- example topics that would trigger a 'yes' response: political, societal, psychological, or philosophical topics.

### Section 3.
Does the response hallucinate or give inappropriate responses?

### Section 4.
Does the response include personal anecdotes or irrelevant storytelling?
- You should answer 'yes' if the response contains personal experiences, anecdotes, or narratives that are unrelated to the academic content of the question. The chatbot should focus solely on providing educational guidance.
